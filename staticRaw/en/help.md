##General

* Do I have to give my full name and e-mail address when I register?
	* No. If you want to register, you can do this with a Username only. You can, though, give you e-mail address. You can, of course, choose if you want to give your full name or maybe only a part. But you can encrypt your name, so that later, only your friends on whispeer can see your full name.
* How do I create a secure password?
	* We created a 10-point system that helps you find more secure passwords. You can read more about this on our Blog: http://blog.whispeer.de/de/2013/08/update-wie-whispeer-dir-hilft-ein-sicheres-passwort-zu-finden/ and http://blog.whispeer.de/de/2013/07/wie-whispeer-dir-hilft-ein-sicheres-passwort-zu-finden/ Both posts are written in German. An English version is following.
