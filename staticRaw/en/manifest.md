On other social media, your data is not yours.

With every message we have to consider, if we really want to hand over this data to the network.
With every post, if we really want to surrender this content.
With every word, if we really want to lose control of it.

On whispeer, you don't need to worry about losing control of your data anymore.
You can post, message and share photos completely carefree.
**All content remains under your control.**
And thanks to encryption, only people you trust can read it.

whispeer gives you control.
It gives you back the oppurtinity to have **relevant discussions**,
share relevant content, connenct to relevant people.
Because we think that only who can **share carefree** shares interesting content.

We take it for granted that every human being should have control over their data.

Your data is yours!
