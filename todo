fixes:
- ui: display friend removal after button click
- check the signed request (when adding and removing a friend)

- re-adding a user to a circle (after removing him) does not work w/o reload
- adding a user to an existing circle does not give him any access rights

- long term: profile management sucks (profiles get lost, created profiles are not there immediatly)
